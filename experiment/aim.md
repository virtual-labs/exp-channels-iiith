Determination of the ﬂow rate of water in open channels is signiﬁcant in many aspects of society. For example, urban and industrial water supplies must be measured so that demands are satisﬁed; the amount of water required for the dilution of pollutants being wasted into a river can be calculated mathematically, but metering devices are required to measure the supplied ﬂow; and ﬂood damage can be determined by correlating the depth of water passing over a dam spillway (a special type of weir) to the volume of water ﬂowing downstream.
