Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Click/Tap on the **Start** button to start the experiment.
2. The water shall start flowing from top container to bottom container through the chosen channel type.
3. The path of the flowing water will change according to the channel type chosen. You can choose the desired channel type by choosing from **Choose channel type** drop-down menu.
4. Try to change the flow speed by using **Control flow speed** glider. Bringing the glider to the left will slow down the water flow whereas bringing it to the right will speed it up!
